 Background 
The Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. F was the backbone of Wehrmacht’s armored divisions at the beginning of the war. First developed as an interim solution for the quickly growing armed forces, it was already outdated when it entered service in the mid thirties. When finally removed from production in 1943, some 1.900 vehicles of various production batches where build. The chassis was continuously used until the end of the war for self propelled anti tank guns and howitzers. The final variant to enter service was Ausführung F, with largely reinforced armor to meet the changed battlefield conditions, in early 1941. The included vehicle is painted in the Colors of the German Afrikakorps to be used in the battles in northern Africa.
